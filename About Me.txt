Hello! My name is Steven Li, and I’m a dedicated Computer Science student at Georgia Tech, set to graduate with my Bachelor’s in Spring 2025 and begin my Master’s in Fall 2025. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve excelled in topics like Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Machine Learning, developing a strong foundation in software development and problem-solving.

Beyond academics, I’ve gained valuable real-world experience through various internships and projects. As a developer for Big Data Big Impact, a project-oriented club, I contributed to building Machine Learning models to assist mental health professionals. My professional experience includes interning at Orca IoT Inc., a startup in Atlanta; Fidelity Investments in Durham, NC, where I worked with the Fidelity Experience Platform Mobile Development team; and Ansys in Atlanta, GA, as part of their Cloud, Solutions & Enablement Team. In Summer 2025, I’m thrilled to join Amazon Web Services in Seattle, WA, for another exciting internship.
